<p id="describe-text">A random IT guy.</p>
<br />
Hiya, I am Francesco one of the many IT workers in the world.

I'm passionate about data and web tech (from theory to dev/ops), I do most of my work on the cloud but sometimes I'm back to the real hardware.

graduated in [Computer Engineering](https://ingegneriacivileinformaticatecnologieaeronautiche.uniroma3.it/) 'cum laude' at [University of Rome "Roma Tre"](https://www.uniroma3.it/).
<br />
