<br />
Hiya, I am Francesco one of the many IT workers in the world.
<br />
I'm passionate about data and web tech (from theory to dev/ops), I do most of my work on the cloud but sometimes I'm back to the real hardware.
<br /> 
I am an alumni and fellow of [CVDLAB](http://cvdlab.org/), Departments of Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Physics from which I've 
graduated in [Computer Engineering](http://www.inf.uniroma3.it) 'cum laude' at [University of Rome "Roma Tre"](http://www.uniroma3.it/).
<br />
<br />
I'm currently enjoying a break! <br />

* Cloud &amp; Integration Architect @ [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/)
